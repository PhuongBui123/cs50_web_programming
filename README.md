Something about this hub:
I would like to bring an educational source for people having been pursuing the course Computer Science for Web Programming delivered by HarvardX. Kindly see my problem set's solution as your references. 

If you are new to programming, please note that you may take my solutions as the ideas to write your own scripts. Just do not copy to avoid the violation related to the course's policy!

If you are a programmer, you are welcome to give me feedbacks to improve my scripts. Thank you very much!
